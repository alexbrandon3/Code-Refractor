# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

In this submission, I have entered existing code for a company's landing page and edited it to be semantically correct and more generally accessible.

*Link to deployed application
https://github.com/alexbrandon3/Homework-1

*Dear grader, to be completely frank, I'm at my wit's end with this README. I've spent quite a few hours trying to figure out how to properly link the screenshot and URL of the deployed application, but I'm fairly certain the image link is not working as it should and Google hasn't illuminated linking the deployed application beyond my level of understanding before my research, so I've simply provided my link to the Github repository. In short, please go easy on me: I've tried hard.
